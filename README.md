# Library-Management-System
This is one of my first projects created in the process of learning python. Here I have tried to create a basic management system for a hypothetical library which would want to go digital

Basics and story behind:
This is my first project that I created to get some hands-on experience on python and file & data management using the same. This project uses very simple python code with no use of OOPs concepts whatsoever. It is completely procedural code which can be recreated in any other programming language.
The basic hypothetical situation that I started with is that there is some library which wishes to go digital. So, this code would cater to its needs and provide some extra functionalities for future scalability. I apologize for the lack of proper documentation of the code!

The repo consists of 2 different files - one for CSV and one for MySQL. Basically, it is the same code with two different data management systems. As it is, they have different system requirements.
Requirements for the programme using CSV file system -
Python version 3.8+,
No extra software requirements.
Hardware requirements - the code has no specific system requirement and should be able to run on any machine.

Requirements for the programme using MySQL RDBMS -
Python version 3.8+,
MySQL RDBMS,
MySQLdb library for connecting python and MySQL,
No other software requirements.
Hardware requirements - the code has no specific requirements and should be able to run on any machine.

I am still new to the world of coding so looking forward to everyone's guidance!
